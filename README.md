# bashscripts

This folder contains Cognitive BashScripts for setting up remote instances

I have set up a general installation file called coginstall.sh.  This sets up a full deep learning/training environment.

It will need further refinement, but it is a good start

I have then created revised shells for 'bash' and 'zsh'.  This was for education purposes mainly, and I will need to learn

how to use some of the libraries and the like, but it helped me understand how shell scripting works.
